***Note***:this is a homework for EECS 398 at U-M in the repository description


## Introduction
Our goal is to predict the ratings of recipes. Our training data comes from the website food.com, where recipe ratings provide a relatively fair measure for evaluating the quality of recipes. These ratings help customers easily choose suitable recipes to try when cooking. Therefore, we aim to predict recipe ratings based on some of their basic information.
